      &quot;Our aim is not to do away with corporations; on the contrary, these
      big aggregations are an inevitable development of modern industrialism.
      ... We are not hostile to them; we are merely determined that they shall
      be so handled as to subserve the public good. We draw the line against
      misconduct, not against wealth.&quot;
